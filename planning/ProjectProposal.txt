General Overview
I want to build an application for a photographer. This site will allow visitors to see a portfolio
of publicly shared photos to get an idea of what the photographer is like. Users will be able to request
reservations and view their own pictures, after a photoshoot. This will allow the photographer to share
their work, and make it easier to stay organized.

Feature List
Must have features
• As a user, I should be able to request a reservation.
• As a user, I should be able to create an account and log in.
• As a user, I should be able to see a portfolio of publicly shared photos.
• As a user, I should be able to click on photos to enlarge them.
• As a logged-in user, I should also be able to see my own photos.
• As an admin, I should be able to upload photos to the public portfolio as well as private portfolios.
• As an admin, I should be able to view reservations including contact information.

Nice to Have Features
• As a user, I should be able to see available time slots for reservation
• As a logged-in user, I should be able to see my current reservations.
• As an admin, I should be able to set times as available or unavailable for reservations.
• As an admin, I should be able to edit or delete reservations.

Technical Challenges
The big difference between this and previous apps I’ve done in this class in dealing with
pictures. I will have to learn how to display them well. I don’t want just a bunch of basic HTML
elements, I want a nice animated portfolio where I can click on images and they will enlarge.
Images will also require more data to be stored, read, and transmitted. This may become a
problem that I will have to overcome.

Requirements
1) I will use React to make my front-end more appealing and interactive.
• I will use Django to handle the database and authentication.
2) There will be separate pages for the public portfolio, private portfolio, creating
reservations, and viewing reservations.

3) Users will be able to login, which will give them access to their photos and their
reservations.
4) This app will be useful for photographers.
5) I will ensure the design stays consistent and use a pleasing color pallette to tie the app
together.
6) The back-end and database will be critical for authentication, storing and retrieving
reservations, and serving the right photos to the right people.
